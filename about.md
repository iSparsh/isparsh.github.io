# About Me
I am Sparsh Mishra, a student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and am currently in the process of completing a Bachelors of Science in Computer Sciences and Mathematics. I did the IB Diploma Programme in India before coming to the U.S. I've enjoyed coding since I was about 13, learning BASIC, VBasic, Python, C, and Java. I also dabbled in a little bit of Rust. Since 2020, i've been openly interested in Linux, contributing to open source and writing my own small scripts here and there. I eventually hope to do a bit more systems-level development before moving onto other things.
