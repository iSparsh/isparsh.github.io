# About Me
I am Sparsh Mishra, a student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and am currently in the process of completing a Bachelors of Science in Computer Sciences and Mathematics. I did the IB Diploma Programme in India before coming to the U.S. I've enjoyed coding since I was about 13, learning BASIC, VBasic, Python, C, and Java. I also dabbled in a little bit of Rust. Since 2020, i've been openly interested in Linux, contributing to open source and writing my own small scripts here and there. I eventually hope to do a bit more systems-level development before moving onto other things. I also became interested in A.I and Machine learning in 2022, eventually completing a summer school at Harvard about that, and co-authoring two papers as a research assistant. Currently, I am in the process of starting a new app - kairos - which will launch soon!
Other than academic interests, I enjoy playing and watching football (soccer), cricket, and chess.
