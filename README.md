This is a repository for my personal website. For now, I have set up a simple markdown experience that allows you, the viewer, to navigate easily following links that should automatically fit all devices. (This is all just an excuse to cover up the fact that my React/JS skills fall in front of my HTML/CSS/MD skills, so I have settled to follow the [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)).
